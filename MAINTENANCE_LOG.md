# Maintenance Log - Final Status

## Date: 2025-01-06

### What Was Attempted:
- Import G10 Yield Curve Animator from Port 3000
- Clean up codebase removing unnecessary components
- Set up professional debugging tools

### What Failed:
- Wrong component imported (not the actual Port 3000 component)
- Component has API compatibility issues with lightweight-charts v5
- Did not verify visual match with original
- Wasted user's time debugging

### Current State:
- 118 modified files staged for review
- G10 component imported but not working correctly
- Debugging tools installed and configured
- Dev server runs on port 3500

### Known Issues:
- G10YieldCurveAnimator.tsx uses `addLineSeries` (v4 API) instead of `addAreaSeries` (v5 API)
- Component styling doesn't match Port 3000 original
- Select dropdowns look different than original
- Component may not be from the correct source project

### Files Modified:
- `/src/components/visualization/G10YieldCurveAnimator.tsx` - Imported component
- `/src/components/visualization/G10YieldCurveAnimatorWrapper.tsx` - Theme wrapper
- `/src/styles/g10-component.css` - Attempted styling fixes
- `/src/core/tabs/componentRegistry.ts` - Added G10 component
- `/src/core/tabs/TabLayoutManager.tsx` - Added G10 tab

### Cleanup Needed:
1. Find correct Port 3000 project and component
2. Copy exact component without modifications  
3. Verify visual match before claiming completion
4. Test all functionality before delivery
5. Remove test files created during debugging

## Recommendation:
The next developer should start fresh by identifying the correct Port 3000 project and copying the exact component without any modifications.
